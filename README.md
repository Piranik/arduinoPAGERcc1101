# arduinoPAGERcc1101
arduino pager 80 character cc1101 module

A Arduino UNO 80 character pager project with 80 character screen.

Using the cc1101 RF module we can send 4 lines of text in 4 20 byte packets to another arduino

we are using the Liquid crystal library and I2C interface for screen

we are using the PANSTAMP library for the CC1101 module with SPI

will post wiring diagram soon..

We will be adding a USB host for keyboard next ( still looking for a smaller qwerty blackberry style keyboard instead ! )

Also will be writing some kind of menu system for creating / sending messages..


currently the PAGER message is manually entered into the array in the code :(
